# Accelarating Analytics using S3 and Databricks

This project aims to accelerate analytics by integrating Databricks with AWS S3 and implementing Agile methodologies using JIRA. We have also utilized various tools such as Excel, Lucid Chart, Databricks, AWS and Power BI to analyze and visualize data.



## Project Overview

Our project is based on analyzing data using various tools and platforms. We have linked AWS S3 with Databricks to access and analyze data stored in S3. We have used CSV files to work on Excel, Databricks and used Lucid Chart to normalize the data. The normalized data was then used to draw insights using Databricks as a platform and create dashboards in Power BI for easy visualization.



## Tools and Technologies Used

- Databricks
- AWS S3
- Excel

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating Databricks with AWS S3 and utilizing various tools and technologies to accelerate analytics. The use of Agile methodologies through JIRA has helped us to streamline our development process and effectively manage our project tasks.

By working on Excel using CSVs and using Lucid Chart for normalization, we were able to prepare our data for analysis. The resulting data was then analysed using Databricks and visualized using Power BI to create interactive and informative dashboards. This allowed us to identify patterns, trends, and insights that would have been otherwise difficult to uncover.

Overall, this project has not only provided us with a deeper understanding of data analytics but also highlighted the importance of using the right tools and technologies to achieve optimal results. We hope that the code, documents, and insights shared in this project will serve as a valuable resource for other individuals and teams looking to accelerate their own data analytics projects.
